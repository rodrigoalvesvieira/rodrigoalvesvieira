I was born and grew up in Recife, Brazil and now live in the United States.

I speak Portuguese, English and currently I'm also learning French.

My favorite programming languages are Go and C++, though that does not mean I'm great at them.

I like to spend time thinking about better ways to improve our software and processes at Zendesk, where I work.

Other than that I love studying classic algorithms and all things Distributed Systems.
